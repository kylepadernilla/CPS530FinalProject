            <h2>Introduction to React</h2>
            <h2><i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i> <b style="font-size: 28px">What is React JS?</b></h2>
            <p>
              React is a front- end, Javascript library, Like <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, that helps make building user interfaces easy.  It is opensource and maintained by Facebook and a few individual companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is mostly used as a base for making single-page or mobile applications, because it is optimal for rapidly retreiving changing data that can be saved.  Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.<br>
              Reacts many features inlcude: 
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Its Declaritive nature Makes the code more pedictable and easy to understand.  designing views for each state within an application and react can effectively render the correct component even when your data changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Its conponent based archetecture allows you to build components that manage their own states and can be composed into complex UI's.  They also pass Data really easily through your app without the need to use DOM's
                </li>
                <li>
                  React can also be implemented anywhere and anyway you need. Rendering on a server can be done by using Node and powermobile apps through React Native
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Thought it is very efficient and intuitive, complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interactions with an API's.

            <h2>Introduction to Flask</h2>
            <h2><i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i> <b style="font-size: 28px">What is Flask?</b></h2>
            <p>
              Flask is and opensource, Python, back-end Micro Web Framwork or <a href="https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">WSIG</a>  (Web Server Gateway Interface). Desgined to be quick and easy, it does not have any database abstractions, form validation or other components that pre-existing third party libraries provide, That is why it is classified as a mircroframework.
            </p>
            <p>
              It began with the implementation around <a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/">Werkzeug</a> and <a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja</a>, but has grown into one of the most popular python webframworks applications.
              Even though it lacks any of its own tools and functions, Flask supports extensions that add application features as if they in flask itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Extensions such as: object-oriented mappers, form validation, upload handling, and several variouse framwork tools.  They are also new ones being provided by the comunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therfore it is up to the developper to choose the tools and libraries they need for any given application.
              Because it doesnt have any components of its own, it may be dificult to find which library you need for a given project, or if it doesnt exist yet.
            </p>
