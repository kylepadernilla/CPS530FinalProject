            <h3>Did they perform to your expectations? </h3>
            <p>
            A: It performed really well, made it easier to design and create websites as you can create components in react.
            </p>

            <h3>Were they difficult to install or configure? </h3>

            <p>
            A: The CDN versison to install it is much easier that npm installing all the react files but the latter part
            would allow you to access more features of react.js.
            </p>

            <h3>Was it easy to create the page(s) with it? </h3>
            <p>A: Yes as it was a front-end framework and one member had experience with previous projects using it.</p>

            <h3>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP?</h3>
            <p>A: No it was much easier as it was basically javascript but more component-based.</p>

            <h3>Would you have done things differently in retrospect? Did you regret your choice of frameworks?</h3>
            <p>A: No, we were satisfied with the outcome.</p>

			<h3>Did they perform to your expectations? </h3>
            <p>
			Flask performs much like we expected form a microframework tha focuses only what we need. The ecosystem allows for developers to mix and match 
			various components. The ability to use extensions makes it intuitive to build simple applications.
            </p>
			<h3>Installation difficulties?</h3>
			<p>The microframework doesn't require many dependencies, making installation itself very lightweight. It can be installed with a simple pip install. 
			</p>
			<h3>
			Ease of creating webpage
			</h3>
			<p>
			Setting up the project directory for Flask was very easy. The creation of a dynamic backend webpage required some creative such as
			using an extension for an ORM and a database. Although Flask doesn't support databases natively, the plugins helped reduce the complexity
			of working with a familiar database (SQLLite). 
			</p>
			<h3>Is there a steep learning curve?</h3>
			<p>Flask has a very slight curve due to its simplicity and very Pythonic nature. Perhaps developers can more easily dive into web applications with
			full-stack frameworks, but the introduction to using Flask is very easy for beginners. 
			</p>
			<h3>Would you have done things differently in retrospect? Did you regret the choice of frameworks?</h3>
			<p>No, we were more than thrilled with the inherent simplicity of implementing a basic web page with Flask.</p>
